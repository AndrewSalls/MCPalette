(WIP) palette generator for Minecraft blocks. The premise: you select 2+ colors and tool generates a gradient between the colors made out of multiple blocks.

Right now only contains a tool for interpreting Minecraft blockstate/model/texture files. Converts these files to RGBA pixel data, and displays them in a test window.
